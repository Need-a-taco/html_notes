<!-- 
Here, we've made a super simple website, however we've focused on decorating
it with some inline CSS. HTML has the ability to put these CSS parameters in
as part of the tags. This is good if we do not want to go through the process
of creating a whole new CSS file, especially if it's just a little bit of
decoration. 

There are two types of parameters that we use in this website. There is
background-color. This parameter changes the entire background of whatever
tag we are currently working with. For example, when we used it up top in
the body tag, it changed the background color of the entire webpage. However,
when we used it with just the paragraph tag, it changed the color of just
that paragraph. 

Secondly, there is the color attribute. This one just changes the text color.
We have shown 3 ways that we can entire in arguments for this attribute.
Firstly, there is just saying the color. CSS recognizes a lot of color names,
so changes are just enterig a basic color like "blue" will do the trick. 

However, we might want more precision. In this case, we can entire in the
exact RGB value. We can do this with the function rbg(x, y, z), where x, y,
and z denote the red, blue, and green values respectively. We can also denote
this color in hexadecimal. If we want to do this, we have to first put a
hashtag before all of the numbers and letters. 

Finally, note that all of this is formatted in a string into the "style"
attribute within our HTML tag. If we are using multiple CSS attributes,
make sure to separate them with a semicolon, as seen above for the paragraph
tag.
