<!-- Now we will use hyperlinks to go between webpages. On
the live server, this will look like we are going to
different pages, but what's really going on under the
hood is that we add the html file as an href parameter. Note
that this is a case where we input a file instead of a
hyperlink. 

Note that we can simply add pageTwo.html as a parameter
because these two files are in the same directory on my
computer. If they are not in the same directory, we would
have to modify the input to adapt to our file structure. -->
