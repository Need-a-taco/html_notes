<!--
Here, we will learn how to use tables in HTML. In this example, we will
use it to show the hours of a store. The <table></table> tags enclose the
entire thing. Then, we have <tr></tr> for each row, as tr stands for
table row. Then, <td> is each cell, as td stands for table data, or even
longer: table data cell element. th stands for table header, and it
seems to bolden the text automatically. 

The parameter bgcolor parameter sets the color of the cell. In this case,
we have also hard coded the widths of each cell to be 100 wide each.
Then, at the top we also need to make the entire table 700 wide, since
7 x 100 = 700. Additionally, notice that the align parameter allows us
to align our text in the cells differently.
