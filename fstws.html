<!-- fstws.html stands for first website 
I am as of now, late November 2023, starting my personal
deep dive into web development. I am following right now
a basic tutorial on Youtube.

<!-- The DOCTYPE thing at the top establishes that it's an html
document that can be displayed on a webpage. It is best practice
to include it. 

It's called a document type declaration (DTD) that specifies the
version of HTML in which the document is written. For example, it
could specify that it is written in HTML5-->

<!-- Below are all the tags. First you need an html tag around
all your code, which inside separates into a head and body. The head
encodes the overview features, which aren't displayed on the head
page. In this case, we established our name "Josh's First Website"
with the title tag. 

Then in the body, we use all the header tags to display text in the
form of bolded headers that get smaller as we go from h1 to h5. 

Overall, very aesthetically pleasing code, pretty to look at. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Josh's First Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is my first lesson in HTML!</h1>
        <hr>
        <h1>Hello, first website!</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Hello, first website!</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Hello, first website!</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Hello, first website!</h4>
        <br>
        <h5>Hello, first website!</h5>
        <br>

<!--Then we might have paragraph tags, which just look like
<p>paragraph text</p>. Additionally, we can add breaks and
horizontal breaks, which look like <br> and <hr>. Note that
these only have opening tags, and do not have closing tags.
These just add space on your webpage between headers or
paragraphs. -->
