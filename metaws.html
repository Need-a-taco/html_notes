<!--
Meta tags give the web browser data about data, or metadata. This tells
the browser useful information about our page. Like a description, 
keywords, author, as seen in lines 6-8. It also adds functionality, like
the charset, which should be UTF-8 for good practice. This is unicode,
and it is very standard and universal. However, we could also choose
something like ASCII if we wanted. 

Viewport can alter how to format our webpage, like how we adapt it to
the size of the screen. We can also use http-equiv to refresh the page
so often. I'm sure there are more features we can do with the meta tags
for more functionality, but at this point it's just about looking it up.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to add meta tags to the head of a HTML document,
not the body.
