<!--
The final part of this tutorial is learning how to make forms in HTML. This is
more just an imcomplete introduction, because in order to make a form actually
useful, we need somewhere to store the data of the form. In this case, we do
not actually create that storage. Rather, we are more interested in making the
HTML elements on a webpage that can get that data from users. It looks cool and
professional. 

We will need <form></form> tags in the body surrounding the entire form. Now,
most of the content consists of label and input tags. The most basic is a
text field. The label is fairly easy, it is just <label>field:</label> with
an attribute called for. 

The for attribute just determines where our mouse or keyboard is shifted to
or focused on after we click on the label. Whatever we type in the for
attribute, it will search for an input tag with that same id attribute, and 
then it will focus on that. 

In this example, clicking on the first name label will automatically bring
our cursor to the first name field so we can start typing our first name.

The id attribute provides a unique identifier for a form control, useful for
styling, scripting, and server-side processing. This is useful for example
when we create javascript code to implement functionality for our webpage.
All of the id attributes will allow us to refer to specific parts of the
form. 

The name attribute is for server-side processing. It is useful for when we
have users actually submitting things. Then, the name attributes will be
the titles under which data is stored. 

Other than that, changing the type attribute of our input tag will modify
the input bars that the user interacts with on the webpage. For example,
changing type to password makes it so the text typed in is hidden. We can
also add a maxlength field to limit the length of text inputed in. 

Other than that, we have provided a bunch of different input types above.
It is all pretty intuitive, so just see the code above for yourself for
review. However, one thing to note is that radio buttons within the same
document can have multiple selected at the same time. 

However, we might want to make it so that only one radio button can be
selected at the same time. This is by adding a name attribute. Only one
under the same name can be selected at the same time. 

Additionally, it is best practice to use div tags to surround each part
when we make the form webpage.
