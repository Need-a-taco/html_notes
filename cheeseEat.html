<!-- 
    Audios can just be an opening tag. For example, if we want, we
    could just have it as <audio controls src="/audios/cheese.mp3">.
    However, the form we have above is good practice, as we put
    multiple possible formats like mp3 or wav to prepare for the
    case that one of them is not supported. If none of them are
    supported, we can just put the message "Not supported"
    
    Note that it doesn't show up on our webpage unless we type in 
    "controls". So far, this is very similar to putting images 
    into our webpage.



    Note that audios tag takes boolean attributes. This means that
    inside the tag, we simply type the word to set it to true, which
    in effect makes it show up on our page. E.g. "controls" makes
    the bar show up. 
    "muted" automatically mutes the audio when we first come onto
    the page. "autoplay" does exactly that, as does "loop".
