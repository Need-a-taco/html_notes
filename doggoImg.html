<!-- We can also display images in our webpage. In this implementation, 
I downloaded the image to my computer. In this case, we downloaded some
images to our images folder, which is typical good practice in larger
projects just so we have a place to store all of our photos.

We display images with the <img> tag. Notice that this only has the
opening tag, and there is not closing tab. 

However, note that we have to access the folder according to our file
structure. Thus, if we have an image file called pic.png inside a
images folder, which is in the same directory as the index.html file.
Thus, we refer to it as \images\pic.png. Cool we got it working.
Note that all this would happen as the parameter or the source 
attribute, which is called src. 

Now if we want to scale our picture, we would modify the height and
width attributes. However, modifying both of these may distort the
proportional dimensions of the picture. So if we just want to rescale
the picture in its original proportions, we should adjust one of the
height or width attributes. 

Then, it is also good practice to add alternate text to our image,
which normally we don't see. However, this becomes useful for text-
readers to read if there is blind functionality enabled on the page.
This is done by inputing a string into the alt attribute. Just like
before, we can add a title attribute, which again is a textbox that
appears after we hover over the image for like 2 seconds. 

We can add one more piece of functionality to our image. We can make
it so that clicking on the image takes you to a different page,
basically embedding a hyperlink or different page within the 
attributes. Note that in order to do this, we put our <img></img>
tags nested inside anchor tags <a></a>, and then we input the
hyperlink into the href attribute in the opening anchor tag, just
like we did for embedding links in text. The only difference is
that now we embed it in an image.
