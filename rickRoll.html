This is a very dense file that tells us a lot about the interplay of HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. First of all, there is just a button, which itself is pretty cool. There
is a lot of inline CSS that we can use to change the appearance of the button.

Then, there are things that can happen when we click the button. We can use anchor
tags to send us to a link, just like we did with images. That's what we've done with
the first button at the top. We've wrapped it in anchor tags and then attached the
link to our desired source. 

The second button just shows us how we can disable the button with the boolean
attribute by typing disabled.

Then, the third button shows how we can have Javascript code inside an HTML file.
We want our button to do something more complex, something that we can control
precisely with a Javascript function. This can be done with the onclick attribute
for a button. 

This attribute tells the webpage what to do in the event of a button click. In
here, we put the name of a Javascript function. Then, inside the script tags, we
implement actual Javascript code and create the function that we named earlier in
our HTML tag. 

Note that the text that we want to change is the paragaph text that says "Hello"
at first. We have to differentiate this text from the other code so that our function
can modidy this text specifically, as opposed to any other text. The way we do this
is with the class attribute. Here, we can call it whatever, as long as we are also
consistent with it in the Javascript function. 

Host the server locally to see what the Javascript can make the button do! Once
again, Javascript is for functionality in the webpage, as we can see. It is simply
a programming language. I'm finally starting to understand this all.

Note here that we have something that says document.somestuff. This is the
Javascript HTML DOM Document Object.

Now this is useful because we have JS and HTML code in the same document. Unlike 
the stuff before I've done with Python, we now want to retrieve data from the
web page. In this case, we want to make the HTML text a variable. 

This is where the JS HTML DOM Doc Obj stuff comes in. See the documentation for
specifics, but here are a few basics. 

document.getElementById(id) : finds an element by its element id.

document.getElementByTagName(name) : find elements by tag name

document.getElementByClassName(name) : find elements by its class attribute

Then we also have stuff to actually change HTML elements.

element.innerHTML = new html content : changes the inner HTML of an elt

element.attribute = new value : changes the attribute value of an HTML elt

element.property = new style = change the style of an elt

There's lots more... I'm having a lot of fun.
