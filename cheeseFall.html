    Just like when it came to audios, we can have multiple formats, using
    video as a opening and closed tag, and then using source tags within
    the video tags. We will do this above, as it is slightly better
    practice in some people's opinions. However, it is also possible to
    just have the opening tag, like this:

    <video height="300" autoplay muted controls src="/videos/thickcheese.mp4">
