<!--
iframe tags are used to embed content from another source into your
own webpage. This is used for advertisements, and it is also commonly
used for hacking.

This can be used maliciously, as we could try to pose as another
webpage, like a banking website, so we get users to type their login
credentials, so we can steal it. For this reason, most major websites
have disabled the ability to use iframe for their websites. However,
for example, bing.com has not disabled iframe, but it does have some
restrictions of how we can resize it in iframe. Wikipedia is more
flexible. 

Note that iframes are self-closing. Also, I had trouble putting
iframe tags in the same document. It may just be the case that there
are browser restrictions on this. 

When we embed other sources in the src parameter, it can be a link
or the file path to another file on our computer. In this example,
we have shown a link. However, in adDisply.html we will show how to 
embed other files.
