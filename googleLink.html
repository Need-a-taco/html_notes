<!-- Now we will be introduced to attributes and hyperlinks.
We all know hyperlinks, like the one for Google.com

The goal of this webpage is to get us to Google via a link. 

https://www.google.com/

This we know. HTML can take these as inputs in our code. More
specifically, we will use attributes. Monkey Brain: Attributes
are additional parameters specified in the opening tags.

<tagname attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">Content</tagname>

In this case, we will use the anchor tag, or <a></a>. This tag
is useful for tagging on hyperlinks. But it can also be used for
document downloads, emails, and phone numbers. The point is, the
anchor tag is useful for attaching or inserting things. 

In this case, the attribute will be the actual link to the content,
so this is where we will put the hyperlink to Google. More
specifically, we will input the hyperlink as a string parameter for 
the href attribute, which specifically takes hyperlinks in the
anchor tag.

Additionally, one piece of functionality we also have
control over is whether google opens up in the same tab or a new
tab. This is done with the target attribute. If we want to open it
in the same tab, we do target=_self, and if we want to open it in
a new tab, we do target=_blank

Note that be default, if no target attribute is specified explicitly,
we have target=_self

Finally, we can add a title attribute. This is a little textbox
that appears when we hover over the content of our anchor tag. 

However,
what the user clicks on in order to get there can is determined 
by what is in between the anchor tags. The code is shown below.
Josh is about to code this up, cool guy emoji.
